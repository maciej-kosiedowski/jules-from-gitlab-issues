# UI Analysis Instructions for Google Antigravity Agent

The current repository (`ai-task-orchestrator`) is a backend service focused on synchronizing GitHub and GitLab tasks. It does not contain any frontend code or UI assets (HTML/CSS/JS).

As such, a direct visual analysis of the homepage is not possible within this context.

**Please provide the following to facilitate the UI/UX analysis:**

1.  **Screenshots:** Capture full-page screenshots of the homepage and any relevant sub-pages.
2.  **Deployment URL:** Provide the URL where the application is currently hosted, if accessible.
3.  **Frontend Repository:** If the frontend exists in a separate repository, please provide access or a link to it.
4.  **Design Mockups:** If the UI is in the design phase, please share the Figma/Sketch/Adobe XD files or exported images.

Once these assets are provided, I can proceed with proposing visual improvements and UX enhancements.
